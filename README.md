Autism Care Project:

This project aims to leverage AI-powered analysis for the early detection and support of individuals with autism. By analyzing structural MRI scans, the system uses advanced algorithms to assess neurological markers associated with autism. The platform provides accurate diagnostic insights, personalized therapy recommendations, and a streamlined process for patients to access support resources. Users can upload their MRI scans for evaluation, take tests related to autism symptoms, and get connected to online therapy sessions for ongoing support. The goal is to improve early diagnosis, enhance understanding, and offer tailored care plans for individuals on the autism spectrum.
